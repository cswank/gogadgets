All Gadgets in the system respond to Robot Command Language (RCL) messages.
A RCL command is a string consisting of:

      <action> <location> <device name> <for|to> <command argument> <units>

So, for example::

    turn on living room light
    turn on living room light for 30 minutes

    heat boiler to 22 C
